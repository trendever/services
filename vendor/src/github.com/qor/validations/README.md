# Validations

Validations provides a means to validate [GORM-backend](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm) models when creating and updating them.

### Register GORM Callbacks

Validations uses [GORM](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm) callbacks to handle validations, so you will need to register callbacks first:

```go
import (
  "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
  "github.com/qor/validations"
)

func main() {
  db, err := gorm.Open("sqlite3", "demo_db")

  validations.RegisterCallbacks(db)
}
```

### Usage

After callbacks have been registered, attempting to create or update any record will trigger the `Validate` method that you have implemented for your model. If your implementation adds or returns an error, the attempt will be aborted.

```go
type User struct {
  gorm.Model
  Age uint
}

func (user User) Validate(db *gorm.DB) {
  if user.Age <= 18 {
    db.AddError(errors.New("age need to be 18+"))
  }
}

db.Create(&User{Age: 10})         // won't insert the record into database, as the `Validate` method will return error

var user User{Age: 20}
db.Create(&user)                  // user with age 20 will be inserted into database
db.Model(&user).Update("age", 10) // user's age won't be updated, will return error `age need to be 18+`

// If you have added more than one error, could get all of them with `db.GetErrors()`
func (user User) Validate(db *gorm.DB) {
  if user.Age <= 18 {
    db.AddError(errors.New("age need to be 18+"))
  }
  if user.Name == "" {
    db.AddError(errors.New("name can't be blank"))
  }
}

db.Create(&User{}).GetErrors() // => []error{"age need to be 18+", "name can't be blank"}
```

Qor Validation add support for [govalidator](https://github.com/asaskevich/govalidator), you could add tag into struct for some common validations, such as check required, numeric, length, etc.

```
type User struct {
	gorm.Model
	Name           string `valid:"required"`
	Password       string `valid:"length(6|20)"`
	SecurePassword string `valid:"numeric"`
	Email          string `valid:"email"`
}
```

## [Qor Support](https://github.com/qor/qor)

[QOR](http://getqor.com) is architected from the ground up to accelerate development and deployment of Content Management Systems, E-commerce Systems, and Business Applications and as such is comprised of modules that abstract common features for such systems.

Validations could be used alone, but it works very nicely with QOR (as a QOR Plugin) - if you have requirements to manage your application's data be sure to check QOR out!

[QOR Demo:  http://demo.getqor.com/admin](http://demo.getqor.com/admin)

If you want to display errors for each form field in QOR Admin, you could register your error like this:

```go
func (user User) Validate(db *gorm.DB) {
  if user.Age <= 18 {
    db.AddError(validations.NewError(user, "Age", "age need to be 18+"))
  }
}
```
